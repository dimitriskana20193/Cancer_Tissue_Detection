# Cancer_Tissue_Detection
An early attempt on finding cancerous tissue among healthy ones.
The images were provided by the University of Copenhagen for training. 
There will be an updated version with data that are more easy to access. 
As of now, this repository contains only one script written in google colab.
There will an upload of an updated version of the project later this month.
